3 Thing in the Ice
2 Surgical Extraction
3 Remand
1 Boseiju, Who Shelters All
3 Snapback
1 Echoing Truth
2 Spellskite

NOTES:
- Boseiju hands down won me every game against control that it came up in.
  Sure I took ~14pts of damage from it before I won, but it never killed me and it
  never will if you draw a Gigadrowse on 1 of your extra turns because you can
  tap their remaining lands for the remainder of the game - ensuring nothing will
  get countered thus allowing you to not use Boseiju any more unless absolutely needed.
- Remand is great against control, against Living End, I feel like 3 is a good number too.
- Surgical Extraction was the tits against Mono Blue Living End control match up! Turn 3
  I played Krufix and they Mana Leaked it. As it resolved I Surgical'ed the remaining 2
  from library + looked at hand + looked through library.. GREAT card!
- Haven't played with Thing yet, everyone online rants & raves over this card though. Most
  talk about running 2-3 main instead of Howling Mind. I have mixed feelings until I test it.
- Snapback too haven't played with yet but seems really good against Humans, Walking Balista
  combo, or lots of other creature combo decks that our meta has.
- Echoing Truth haven't played with but seems good against Merfolk, Humans, obvious against
  tokens but havent played against a token deck, random planswalkers/encantments.
- Spellskite havent played against but good against burn (which is why I justfied taking out
  Radient Fountains from main, since I have these in side board)...

+ I kill Dredge, we are favored before and after sideboard.
+ I think I got lucky against Grixis Deathshadow, but Surgical + Gigadrowse are best here.
+ I got KILLED hard core against Storm. Really need to think of a way to stop this deck.
+ I'm not favored against Mono Blue Living End control 1st match, but KILL games 2 and 3.
+ I kill Living End, taping creates, countering living end, such a good match up for us.
