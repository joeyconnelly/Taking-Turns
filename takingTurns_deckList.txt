NOTES:
@ GP likely to see Ghost Quarter (target land) + Field of Ruin (target non-basic),
  so we should cut Ororo + Mikokoro + Minamo.. I wouldn't cut Gemstone unless I really felt like the 
  above 2 land hate cards are going to be BIG, because Gemstone's upside if you lost game 1 is SO high,
  especially against any kind of control!!!
