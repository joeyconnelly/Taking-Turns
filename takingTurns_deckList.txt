NOTES:
@ GP likely to see Ghost Quarter (target land) + Field of Ruin (target non-basic),
  so we should cut Ororo + Mikokoro + Minamo.. I wouldn't cut Gemstone unless I really felt like the 
  above 2 land hate cards are going to be BIG, because Gemstone's upside if you lost game 1 is SO high,
  especially against any kind of control!!!
- I felt like Radiant flames was terrible when I needed Gigadrowse to act like an expensive Cryptic
  to tap down Dredge or Living End creatures... I feel like removing these and putting in basics makes
  Gigadrowse a more powerful card against more opponents than the upside of Radiant Fountains against
  only a few select decks like Burn.
- Inkmoth Nexus seems great... it will give me another win con that has the same weaknesses as any other
  land that I give the counter to. After testing I might put a 2nd, but havent gotten to play with it yet.
- I hated Elixir of Immortality, it was never impactful and out of ALL of my games I never decked myself,
  got close plenty of times but never needed the shuffle.
- I liked Walk the Aeons, casted the buyback once which was nice, but I think having a 3rd copy of my win
  con over the 1 copy of Walk the Aeons is better.

*** I would like to run 23 lands. I would also like to run a 3rd Exhaustion... after testing lets see
***   what I can cut.. thinking 1 spreading seas + 1 howling mine -> let's keep this in mind.
